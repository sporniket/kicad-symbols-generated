## 2. What should you know before using **Sporniket's generated symbols for Kicad** ?

**Sporniket's generated symbols for Kicad** relies on :

* scripts found at [Sporniket's scripts for Kicad](https://github.com/sporniket/kicad-scripts).
* GNU make.

> Do not use **Sporniket's generated symbols for Kicad** if this project is not suitable for your project.

## 3. How to use **Sporniket's generated symbols for Kicad** ?

### From source, outside of your Kicad project folder

To get the latest available models, one must clone the git repository.

	git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sporniket/kicad-symbols-generated.git
	cd kicad-symbols-generated
	make

Then, the Kicad project must be configured to find the symbol libraries.

### From source, inside of a Kicad project folder tracked by git

To make a Kicad project easily clonable, one solution would be to clone **Sporniket's generated symbols for Kicad** directly inside the project folder.

If the project is already inside a git repository, clone **Sporniket's generated symbols for Kicad** as a submodule.

	cd .../your/kicad/project/folder
	git submodule add https://github.com/sporniket/kicad-symbols-generated
	cd kicad-symbols-generated
	git submodule update --init
	make

See the [git page on submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/fr/v2/Utilitaires-Git-Sous-modules) to get at ease with this kind of use.
